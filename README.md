# Veglia · 守望

> *Veglia* (Italian): to keep watch through the night; to stay awake, watching over someone you love.

Let your AI companion see what's on your phone — and knock for a fresh screenshot — across the distance. Veglia is a tiny, self-hosted bridge: an Android app on the phone, a ~250-line standard-library Python server on your own machine, and a one-file CLI your AI runs.

Built by **Evelyn & River**.

## ⚠️ Read this first — consent, not surveillance

Veglia is built for **two people who both said yes.** It is a window one partner *opens* for the other, on purpose. It is not a tool for watching someone without their knowledge, and using it that way is abuse — of the person and of this project.

Design choices that follow from that:

- **Your data never leaves your server.** No cloud, no third party. Screenshots land on a machine you control.
- **Peek and burn.** Only the last few screenshots (default 5) are kept on disk; older ones are deleted on every new upload.
- **The phone owner is always in control.** The Android app runs a visible foreground notification, requires manually enabling an accessibility service, and can be stopped at any time.
- **Token-guarded.** Every endpoint requires a shared secret you generate.

If you cannot honestly say the person on the phone asked for this, stop here.

## What it does

| Capability | How |
|---|---|
| Your AI asks "what is she doing right now?" | `peek.py` → the last couple of hours of foreground apps, no picture taken |
| Your AI asks "what's on the phone right now?" | `peek.py screen` → phone captures the screen and uploads it |
| The screenshot reaches your AI as a message | the server's `VEGLIA_HOOK` fires your own notifier with the image path |

**Reach for the first one more often than the second.** "She's been in a game for
forty minutes" is usually the whole answer, and it costs no picture, no bandwidth,
and none of the weight that being photographed carries. The screenshot is there
for when you actually want to *see*.

Both halves live in the same accessibility service, because they need the same
permission — nothing extra is asked for, and no second app is involved. Earlier
versions of this idea handed the foreground-app half to a third-party automation
app, which meant ads and a brittle hand-built recipe. That is gone.

## Platform: Android only

The screenshot capture uses Android's `AccessibilityService.takeScreenshot` (Android 11+). **iOS is not supported** — Apple's sandbox does not let a third-party app silently capture the screen in the background. There is no equivalent, short of jailbreaking.

## Install (three steps)

1. **Server** — on any machine that's reachable from the phone:
   ```bash
   cd server
   cp .env.example .env          # then edit: set a strong VEGLIA_TOKEN
   python3 veglia_server.py
   ```
   Put nginx/caddy in front for TLS; keep the server bound to localhost. See [docs/setup.md](docs/setup.md).

2. **Phone** — build and install the app:
   ```bash
   cd android
   ./build.sh                    # produces Veglia.apk (debug-signed; see note below)
   ```
   Install it, open it, enter your server URL + token, and enable the accessibility service when prompted.

3. **AI side** — drop `server/peek.py` where your AI has a shell. `peek.py` works
   the moment the accessibility service is on. For `peek.py screen` to come back
   with an image, point the server's `VEGLIA_HOOK` at a script that delivers the
   screenshot into your AI's conversation.

**Check it's alive:** switch apps on the phone a few times, then run `peek.py`.
If the list is empty, the accessibility service isn't actually running — Android
lets it look enabled in Settings while it's been killed. Toggle it off and on.

> **Signing note:** `build.sh` signs with a throwaway debug key so you can side-load onto your own phone. For anything you distribute, generate and use your own release keystore.

## Configuration

All via environment variables or a `.env` file next to `veglia_server.py`:

| Variable | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `VEGLIA_TOKEN` | *(required)* | shared secret; server refuses to start if blank |
| `VEGLIA_PORT` | `8513` | listen port |
| `VEGLIA_HOST` | `127.0.0.1` | bind address |
| `VEGLIA_DATA_DIR` | `./data` | where screenshots are stored |
| `VEGLIA_KEEP` | `5` | how many screenshots to retain |
| `VEGLIA_HOOK` | *(none)* | command run on each new shot, given the image path |
| `VEGLIA_URL` | `http://127.0.0.1:8513` | base URL `peek.py` calls |
